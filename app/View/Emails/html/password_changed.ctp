<p>Hi <?php echo $name; ?>,</p>
<p>The password for your MUVE account - <?php echo $email; ?> - was recently changed.</p>
<p>If you made this change, you don't need to do anything more.</p>
<p>If you didn't change your password, your account might have been hijacked. To get back into your account, you'll need to reset your password. </p>
