Hi <?php echo $name; ?>,

The password for your MUVE account - <?php echo $email; ?> - was recently changed.
If you made this change, you don't need to do anything more.
If you didn't change your password, your account might have been hijacked. To get back into your account, you'll need to reset your password.
